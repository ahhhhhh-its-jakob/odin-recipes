    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy Lasagna Recipe is meaty, cheesy, and packed with flavor in every bite. Homemade lasagna is better than any restaurant version and it feeds a crowd for way less than going out to eat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry red wine or beef broth</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>24 oz Marinara Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp black pepper, ground</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp granulate sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles, cooked al dente</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375˚F. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt and 9 lasagna noodles. Cook until al dente according to package instructions.</li>
        <li>Spread 1/2 cup meat sauce in the bottom of a deep 9×13 casserole dish. Add 3 noodles, spread on 1/3 of the meat sauce, and sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Spoon on and spread the top with 1/2 of your cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have 3 layers of noodles:
            Add 3 noodles, 1/3 meat sauce, 1 cup mozarella cheese, 1/2 cheese sauce
            Add 3 noodles, remaining 1/3 meat sauce, remaining 1 cup mozarella.</li>
        <li>Poke 9-12 toothpicks over the surface of your lasagna (to keep the foil from sticking to the cheese). Cover with foil and bake at 375˚F for 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove foil and broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese turns golden. Let lasagna rest 30 min before slicing. </li>
    </ol>
